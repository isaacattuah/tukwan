    "True/False": false,
    "Explanation": "For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be equal to - 1. If the two slopes are positive their product cannot be negative. Hence the statement \"Two lines with positive slopes can be perpendicular\" is FALSEFor two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be equal to - 1. If the two slopes are positive their product cannot be negative. Hence the statement \"Two lines with positive slopes can be perpendicular\" is FALSE",
